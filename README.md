# CSC 249 - ICMP Ping and Traceroute

_Assignment for CSC 249: Networks at Smith College._

Learning more about the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) by implementing ping and traceroute applications. The ping tool tests host reachability and measures round-trip time (RTT) using ICMP echo packets, while traceroute identifies the path that data packets take across the network by sending ICMP requests with increasing time-to-live (TTL) values.

Analyze the ping and traceroute data by creating scatterplots that compare RTT and geographic distance, as well as hops and geographic distance.
